# X-Ray
In this module we will build an end to end solution like Prime Video X-Ray to recognize mainstream and custom celebrities. We use RecognizeCelebrities and SearchFacesByImage APIs to recognize mainstream and custom celebrities.

## Pre-requisites
This module requires completion of previous modules:
 - [Celebrity Recognition](https://github.com/darwaishx/celebrity-recognition/tree/master/1-celebrity-recognition)
 - [Recognize Custom Celebrities](https://github.com/darwaishx/celebrity-recognition/tree/master/2-recognize-custom-celebrities)

## Extend Media Analysis Solution
In this step we will create a SageMaker Notebook instance using CloudFormation template. SageMaker is not required to use Rekognition, but we will use SageMaker as IDE for quick prototyping and to learn various Rekognition APIs.

1. Click on one of the buttons below to launch CloudFormation template in an AWS region.
